    1.  Issue : How to use docker compose?
        Good thing is I have used vagrant so, even tough I haven't used Docker I have an idea of how it works
        Went trought the docker docs and installed Docker and Docker compose
        For Docker : https://docs.docker.com/install/#server
        https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
        Followed the steps in the documentation, was straightforward
        For Docker componse : https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

    2.  Went trought the docs to see how to setup the env for the challenge
        https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/#step-4-build-and-run-your-app-with-compose
        Error while trying to run docker compose:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44800484/docker-couldnt-connect-to-docker-daemon-at-httpdocker-localunixsocket-is-i#45528428
        Tried building the image by hand with docker instead of docker-compose
        "Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at"
        There was a permission issue with the Docker daemon because my user was not automatically added to the docker group
        Ran docker-compose up again and the build works this time

    3.  How to fix the network issues?
        I need to understand docker config first : https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/
        
        I need to set the nginx to be exposed on localhost:8080 and forward the requests to the API
        As I haven't used nginx in a while and I'm not 100% familiar with Docker config I used this medium post as a reference:
        https://medium.com/@francoisromain/setup-node-js-apache-nginx-reverse-proxy-with-docker-1f5a5cb3e71e

        For the API issue I read this docs:
        https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/
        After a while of reading how the docker networks work and playing around with the docker cli
        I list the docker containers using docker container ls and see that the API container is misconfigured (0.0.0.0:32770->8080/tcp):

        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
        958b209f4f26        challenge_app       "api"                    19 minutes ago      Up 9 minutes        0.0.0.0:32770->8080/tcp   api
        04277dce40c3        challenge_nginx     "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   3 hours ago         Up 9 minutes        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp      server
        e97a032d1385        mysql:5.7           "docker-entrypoint.s…"   16 hours ago        Up 9 minutes        3306/tcp                  db

        Accessing http://localhost:32770/item/1 in my browser confirms the issue as I see error output from the API:
        {
            description: "sql: no rows in result set",
            error: "find_error"
        }
        
        I start using docker container inspect/port/logs/etc to troubleshoot the issue
        Even tough I have an idea of what I need to do things are not working as expected.
        I have setup, for now, all the container having a public port so I can acces the db and the app, work on them
        and I'll come back to this issue latter

        actual config (docker container ls output):
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
        406c26876e0e        challenge_app       "api"                    5 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:32774->8080/tcp   api
        e1f9d7186764        mysql:5.7           "docker-entrypoint.s…"   5 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:32773->3306/tcp   db
        95dac5642446        challenge_nginx     "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   35 minutes ago      Up 4 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp      proxy

        After several hours of not having a clue about what was wrong with my network config I discovered that there was nothing wrong with my config
        It was the way I was building the docker images what was wrong (such a nice waste of time! hahaha)

    4.  I haven't used golang before so I need to install it and learn a some syntax to complete the challenge
        Installed go following the docs on their page : https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz
        Installed support for go on my vscode
        Also tried the goland IDE
        
    5.  Google drive API integration
        Used the quickstart guide : https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/go

    6.  Configuring the database to load scripts on init
        Read the dockerfile for the image version https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/ad625c64a06e16683e997e5a0147508d115f4989/5.7/Dockerfile

    7.  Connect app to db
        The connection string is not working so I start reading the doc for the mysql driver on github and implement a ping on the dbconnection fucntion to
        see if the db name resolution is being done correctly from the docker instance

        out, _ := exec.Command("ping", "db", "-c 5", "-i 3", "-w 10").Output()
        if strings.Contains(string(out), "Destination Host Unreachable") {
            fmt.Println("TANGO DOWN")
        } else {
            fmt.Println("IT'S ALIVEEE")
        }

    8.  Testing the app
        For testing/debugging I'm using ZAP so I can mess with the requests and also use the automated scanners/fuzzers to find and, potencially, patch vulnerabilities

    9.  Securing nginx
        I used this as a reference: https://gist.github.com/plentz/6737338

    10. Unit tests
